### For this assignment, we will be investigating the Numpy.Random package.  

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. (Scipy.org)

Numpy.random is a package within the library Numpy. It generates as many random numbers as you wish, and returns them in an Numpy array/arrays, rows and columns.

There are numerous different ways of generating random numbers, which you can then display your findings on histograms. 



### We will be investigating as follows: 

- Investigating the purpose of the package.
- Simple random data, and the permutation functions.
- Thorough explanation of the distribution functions and their purpose.
- And finally we will be looking at the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### Jupyter Notebook, and how to use one for this project.

For this assignment we will be using a Jupyter notebook to write the functions within numpy.random and explain our code.

### How to get started and run Jupyter Notebook.

- How to get <a href="https://learn.onemonth.com/jupyter-notebook-a-beginners-tutorial/" target="_blank">started</a>

•	Create a new repository on Github, name it, initialize a ReadMe, Add.gitignore-Python, license, and click on clone/download and copy the link.

•	Go to your command line, cd desktop, and type: git clone, space and right click. Creates folder you just created on Github.

•	CD into folder, type Jupyter Notebook, which is older but more reliable, press enter, opens a browser, click on Notebook Python 3.

•	Rename file.

•	Type in some code and hold down shift and hit enter to display the code. Save!

•	Shut down browser. (When you want to re-use or open up Jupyter again, re-start the kernel and run all cells, previous code might not work otherwise, which you had entered.)

•	Go to command line, control plus c and release. Clears Python and and goes back to (master-origin).

•	Git status

•	Git add . 

•	Git commit –m “Name of what you created or done”.

•	Git push

•	Repository, ReadMe and Gitignore created.

Please find in the Jupyter Notebook file, an investigation into the Numpy.Random package, and some examples of how to generate random numbers.
