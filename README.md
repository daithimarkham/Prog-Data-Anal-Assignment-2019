### For this assignment, we will be investigating the Numpy.Random package.  

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. It is a Python library that provides a multidimensional array object, various derived objects (such as masked arrays and matrices), and an assortment of routines for fast operations on arrays, including mathematical, logical, shape manipulation, sorting, selecting, I/O, discrete Fourier transforms, basic linear algebra, basic statistical operations, random simulation and much more. (Scipy.org)

Numpy.random is a package within the library Numpy. It generates as many random numbers as you wish, and returns them in an Numpy array/arrays, rows and columns.
There are numerous different ways of generating random numbers, which you can then display your findings on histograms.





### We will be investigating as follows: 

- Investigating the purpose of the package.
- Simple random data, and the permutation functions.
- Thorough explanation of the distribution functions and their purpose.
- And finally we will be looking at the use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers.

### Jupyter Notebook.

For this assignment we will be using a Jupyter notebook to write the functions and explain our code.
